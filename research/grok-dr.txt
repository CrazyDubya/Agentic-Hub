Academic Papers
Academic research focuses on LLMs as simulators, world models, and frameworks for integrating simulations with AI for decision-making and behavior modeling.
	•	Can Language Models Serve as Text-Based World Simulators? (2024): This paper evaluates LLMs like GPT-4 as simulators for text-based virtual environments, introducing a benchmark (ByteSized32-State-Prediction) to test state transition predictions. Key findings show GPT-4 achieves up to 59.9% accuracy on non-trivial changes but struggles with environment-driven transitions (49.7% accuracy), arithmetic, and common-sense reasoning. Humans outperform LLMs, highlighting areas for improvement. Code and data available. arXiv link 75 Original search result 6 
	•	Simulation Agent: A Framework for Integrating Simulation and Large Language Models for Enhanced Decision-Making (2025): Proposes a framework combining simulations’ accuracy with LLMs’ natural language interfaces to make complex systems accessible to non-technical users. It supports scenario exploration, parallel executions, and query-based interactions, addressing challenges like input/output handling. Future work includes multi-agent expansions and validation.
