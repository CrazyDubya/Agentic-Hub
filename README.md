# Agentic-Hub
## Universal Agent Research Platform

A game engine-style platform for simulating any scenario while providing deep introspection into AI agent behavior and inner workings.

## Vision

Build a universal simulation engine that can:
- **Simulate any scenario**: Prison, physics lab, corporation, D&D session, theatre
- **Deep agent analysis**: Understand agents better than their creators
- **Universal workflow support**: n8n → LangChain → Custom Python → txt configs
- **Modular architecture**: Mix, match, activate, deactivate agents and workflows

## Key Features

### 🎮 Game Engine Architecture
- Scene/World management system
- Entity-Component-System for agents
- Real-time scenario orchestration
- Hot-swappable environments

### 🤖 Universal Agent Integration
- Support for all major frameworks (Swarms, Dify, Eliza, TinyTroupe, LangChain)
- Dual-copy system (original + enhanced versions)
- Agent lifecycle management
- Cross-framework compatibility

### 🔍 Deep Agent Analysis
- Real-time agent introspection
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Decision tree visualization
- Agent "psychology" profiling
- Performance optimization insights

### 🌍 Scenario Templates
- **Prison Simulation**: Social dynamics, rehabilitation studies
- **Physics Research**: Collaborative discovery, hypothesis testing
- **Corporate Environment**: Decision-making, office dynamics
- **D&D Sessions**: Creative problem-solving, storytelling
- **Theatre Exploration**: Character development, narrative creation
